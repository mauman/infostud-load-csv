Enters verbalization data into the Sapienza Infostud crappy system, saving your time and mental health.
Just add it through Tampermonkey, then select "Browse" and "Load CSV" in the UI.
The csv format is the following:

matriculation, name, surname, email, grade (R = rinuncia, A = assente [optional]), [optional] date (DD/MM/YYYY)

Enjoy!
